                Graphlib-dot is a [DOT language] parser and writer for
                [graphlib][] graphs.

                This documentation describes the Graphlib-dot API. Please visit our
                [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cpettitt/graphlib-dot) for
                more general information.

            h2 Relationship to Graphlib
            :markdown
                This library adds two new graph types:

                1. `DotGraph` (prototype is [`CGraph`](http://cpettitt.github.io/project/graphlib/latest/doc/index.html#CGraph))
                2. `DotDigraph` (prototype is [`CDigraph`](http://cpettitt.github.io/project/graphlib/latest/doc/index.html#CDigraph))

                DOT graphs differ from the graphlib compound graphs in that
                they always contain an object for their value. This is similar
                to how attributes work with graphs in graphviz.
