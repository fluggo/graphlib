h2#DotGraph DotGraph
:markdown

    A `Graph` with support for composition using subgraphs. The following code
    creates a new instance of `DotGraph`:

    ```js
    var DotGraph = require("graphlib-dot").DotGraph;
    var graph = new DotGraph();
    ```
h3#DotGraph-hasSubgraph graph.hasSubgraph(id)
:markdown
    Returns `true` if the subgraph with the id `id` is a member of this graph
    and `false` if not.

    ```js
    graph.hasSubgraph("sg1");
    // => false

    graph.addSubgraph("sg1");
    graph.hasSubgraph("sg1");
    // => true
    ```

h3#DotGraph-subgraph graph.subgraph(id, [value])
:markdown
    This function provides a mechansim to get and set a user-defined value on
    an individual subgraph. With one argument this function returns the value
    currently assiged to the subgraph with the id `id`. With two arguments
    this function replaces the current value of the subgraph `id` with `value`.
    The initial value for a subgraph is the empty Object (`{}`).

    If there is no subgraph `id` in the graph this function will throw an
    `Error`. It will also throw an `Error` if the value supplied is not an
    Object.

    ```js
    graph.addSubgraph("sg1");
    graph.subgraph("sg1");
    // => {}

    graph.subgraph("sg1", {a: "xyz"});
    graph.subgraph("sg1");
    // => { a: "xyz" }

    graph.subgraph("foo");
    // throws an Error

    graph.subgraph("sg1", "non-object value");
    // throws an Error
    ```

h3#DotGraph-subgraphs graph.subgraphs()
:markdown
    Returns the ids of all subgraphs in this graph. Use
    [`graph.subgraph(id)`](#DotGraph-subgraph) to get the value for a specific
    subgraph.

    ```js
    graph.subgraphs();
    // => []

    graph.addSubgraph("sg1");
    graph.addSubgraph("sg2");
    graph.subgraphs();
    // => [ "sg1", "sg2" ]
    ```

h3#DotGraph-parent graph.parent(id, [parent])
:markdown
    This function returns the current parent of the object (node, edge,
    subgraph) with the id `id` if only one argument is supplied. If two
    arguments are supplied this function sets the parent of `id` to the graph
    `parent`. If `parent` is `null` this effectively sets the parent to the
    root graph.

    This function will throw an `Error` if `id` is not in the graph or if
    `parent` is either not in the graph or is not a graph object.

    ```js
    graph.addNode(1);
    graph.parent(1);
    // => null

    graph.addSubgraph("sg1");
    graph.parent(1, "sg1");
    graph.parent(1);
    // => "sg1"

    graph.parent("sg1", 1);
    // throws an Error

    graph.parent("foo", "bar");
    // throws an Error
    ```

h3#DotGraph-children graph.children(id)
:markdown
    Returns the ids of all children of the graph or subgraph with the id `id`.
    The id `null` can be used to get immediate children of the root graph.

    The child values are tuples of `{ id, type }` where `id` is the object's
    (node, edge, graph) id and `type` is one of "node", "graph", or "subgraph".

    If `id` is not in this graph or if it is not the id of a graph object, this
    function will throw an `Error`.

    ```js
    g.children(null);
    // => []

    g.addNode(1);
    g.children(null);
    // => [ { id: 1, type: "node" } ]

    g.addSubgraph("sg1");
    g.children(null);
    // => [ { id: 1, type: "node" },
    //      { id: "sg1", type: "subgraph" } ]

    g.parent(1, "sg1");
    g.children(null);
    // => [ { id: 1, type: "node" } ]
    g.children("sg1");
    // => [ { id: "sg1", type: "subgraph" } ]
    ```

h3#DotGraph-addSubgraph graph.addSubgraph(id, [value])
:markdown
    Adds a new subgraph with the id `id` to this graph. The subgraph is
    assigned the value of `value` if it is specified; otherwise it defaults to
    the empty object (`{}`). If an object with the id `id` is already present
    in the graph this function will throw an `Error`.

h3#DotGraph-delSubgraph graph.delSubgraph(id)
:markdown
    Removes a subgraph from this graph that has the id `id`. Any children of
    this subgraph are made children of this subgraph's parent.

    If the graph does not contain a subgraph with the id `id` this function
    will throw an `Error`.

    ```js
    g.addSubgraph("sg1");
    g.addNode(1);
    g.parent(1, "sg1");
    g.children(null);
    // => [ { id: "sg1", type: "subgraph" } ]

    g.delSubgraph("sg1");
    g.children(null);
    // => [ { id: 1, type: "node" } ]
    ```
