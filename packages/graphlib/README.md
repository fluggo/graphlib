# Graphlib

Graphlib is a JavaScript library that provides data structures for undirected and directed multi-graphs along with algorithms that can be used with them.

<h2 style="color: red;">About this version</h2>

This is a TypeScript port of Graphlib and probably soon several of its companion libraries.
Graphlib was originally written and maintained by Chris Pettitt.

I, Brian Crowell, am exploring Graphlib and its other libraries.
I am publishing my packages, but at this time I am not committing to maintaining them, and I certainly don't guarantee I won't make breaking changes in the future.
I am happy to accept pull requests, though.

You can find the original Graphlib [here](https://github.com/dagrejs/graphlib).
